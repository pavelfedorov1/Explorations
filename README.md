# Explorations - I present two implementations, one in R and one in Python of how to create an Empirical CDF from a data sample and then calculate its inverse in a simple way without the heavy use of libraries. 

The code is presented together with Latex definitions and descriptions and may be used to create single-variable CDFs from empirical data collected without the need to assume a distribution from known families. 

Inverse transform sampling is also used to calculate an inverse cdf which in turn may be used in optimisation applications as an example.
