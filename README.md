# Explorations - I present two implementations, one in R and one in Python showing how to create an Empirical CDF from a data sample and then calculate its inverse in a simple way without the heavy use of libraries. 

The code is presented together with Latex definitions and descriptions and may be used to create single-variable CDFs from empirical data collected without the need to assume a distribution from known families. 

Inverse transform sampling is also used to calculate an inverse cdf which in turn may be used in optimisation applications as an example. 

Simple comparisons and visualizations are used to give a sense of the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach using an Exponential Distributed Sample as a basis.
