# Explorations 

1. Empirical CDF: Two notebooks presenting the Empirical CDF and showing how to calculate its inverse in R and Python with heavy use of libraries

The code is presented together with Latex definitions and descriptions and may be used to create single-variable CDFs from empirical data collected without the need to assume a distribution from known families. 

Inverse transform sampling is used to calculate an inverse empirical cdf which in turn may be used in optimisation applications as an example. 

Simple comparisons and visualizations are used to give a sense of the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach using an Exponential Distributed Sample as a basis.

Finally the Newsvendor model is presented as a direct case where we can apply the proposed theory into practice.

2. Multi-period Inventory: Use Calculus and Dynamic programming to find the optimal order quantity
